- Chose to explore Nextjs as I saw that a lot of teams in the previous SoC bootcamps used Nextjs in their ginal projects. Also, hearing lots of recomendations for Nextjs.
- learned the fundamentals of now NextJs works. routing, component structuring, the different ways Next can render a page, Setting up a basic page. retrieving date before render using getStaticProps. Also learned a bit about deployment. I deployed the site on Vercel.
